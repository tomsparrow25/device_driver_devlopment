make -C /usr/src/linux-headers-3.2.0-33-generic-pae/ SUBDIRS=$PWD modules
make dep
make modules
make
make modules_install install

if you want to run multi "make " process you can add -jn after "make",like this
make -j10 modules

edit /boot/grub/menu.lst,change the path of "kernel" and "initrd"
you will find the former has a file associated in "/boot/",such as vmlinuz-3.2.0-33-generic-pae but the initrd 
should be manully made by yourself.
run "mkinirtd -o /boot/3.2.0-33.img 3.2.0-33",after this command you will get this file initrd.img-3.2.0-33-generic-pae
and copy this .img file to /boot,and then change the contents of /boot/grub/menu.lst.
then you can reboot your computer and enjoy your new kernel!
